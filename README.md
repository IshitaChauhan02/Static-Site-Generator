# Static-Site-Generator
A project that creates static files from the given data.

The process typically involves writing content in Markdown and using templates(CSS, Bootstrap) to define the structure and design of the file. The static site generator then combines the content with the templates to produce a complete set of static files(HTML).

Working:
The markdown files are stored in md-files under app.
The templates are added into templates under app.
Run the project (main.py)
Static files are created and stored in static-files under app.
